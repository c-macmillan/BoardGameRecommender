Minus points: The board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening. The rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you'd expect to find them though. The addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players. We found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough. Lots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you've just done in order to replace it with something legal. AP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.

Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing.   Everything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts.   The rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links.

I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.  DISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.  OVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours.

In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain.   Another change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.  I really cannot decide between this and the original.

Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.  It's an intriguing game of give and takes. It's mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it's very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress.   Every system in the game is well designed and thought out.

You'll have to utilize your opponent's resources and infrastructure to advance your goals.   Many games remove all 'take-that' mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision.   I found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.  Overall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!\"},\n",

       "  '@value': \"This is one of the few games in the bgg top 10 that definitely deserves it. There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.\"},\n",

       "  '@value': \"Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass: Lancashire by Martin Wallace (Railways of the World, AuZtralia, Wildlands). It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.  [b]What makes it special?[/b]  * Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management * Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made) * 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game  [b]Pros:[/b]  + Artwork Beautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence  + Theme Industrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.  + Components Double sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards  + Many paths to victory Ship cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.  + Two eras (similar, but different) The game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played.   + The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency) The develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.  + Network building (optimal routes and scoring) Links are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)  + Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing) Each player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).  + Wild cards (flexibility) A player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)  + Discard any card for various actions (flexibility) A player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.  + Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency) One discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?  [-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]  + Loans for instant cash income (flexibility) Loans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative.   + Resource management (coal, iron, and bear) Iron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)  + Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator) Players can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)  + Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring) Shipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)  + Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer) Beer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)  + Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points  + Turn order by spent money It is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)  + Random set-up (variability, replayability) Demand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently  + Helpful player boards  Show all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)  + Clarity Clear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.  + Motivating game arc (escalation) Restrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.  + Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)  + Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)  + Brief, well written rules (12 pages) However, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)  + Game box has a nice plastic insert  [b]Neutrals:[/b]  # The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract  # Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)  # High player interaction due to different synergy effects  # Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)  # Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)  # Luck of the draw for cards  # Locations are color-coded on the map and cards  Helps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham  # Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)  # Deluxe edition  Has poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)  # Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire No distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board  [b]Cons:[/b]  - Potentially overwhelming The rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?  - Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline) Do not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.  (-) Setting up the player boards  Placing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.  - Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income  [i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)  [b]Thoughts:[/b]  Brass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!  [b]Similar games:[/b]  * Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry Very similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry. Both games by Martin Wallace.  * On Mars Synergistic player interaction, a lot of options, less streamlined, steep learning curve.  * Autobahn Synergistic network building plus pick up and delivery with Concordia-style hand management.  * Railways of the World Less complex, focus on route building, some synergy via route sharing, simpler supply and demand for delivering goods, loans and income, event cards (more randomness), auctions for player order, by Martin Wallace.  * Wildcatters Synergistic network building with cut-throat denying of oil barrels or shares.  * Imperial Steam  [b]Missing rules:[/b]  * What happens if you run out of iron cubes? https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2028859/lack-orange-iron-cubes * How to draw cards at the start of the rail era? https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2031687/draw-8-cards-start-rail-era\"},\n",

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

Also, it&#039;s terrible at demonstrating the possible value of different strategies, other than the general &quot;rail building&quot; path. Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!) But this game itself is under developed.\\n\\nExploring a game by playing it is fun, but  it&#039;s usually about learning how to do a strategy, and not finding out, how well a strategy preforms.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"6legsci\" rating=\"N/A\">Vault</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"72tigers\" rating=\"3\">Worker placememt</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"75dragon\" rating=\"7\">Beer</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaedien\" rating=\"N/A\">3pp, 4pp (2-4)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarkas\" rating=\"9\">Kickstarter</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AaronBE85\" rating=\"8.5\">X.TRS</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AbacoBilbao\" rating=\"N/A\">[Estante 08]\\n[M000143]</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abdul\" rating=\"9\">Excellent and highly interactive game. Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos! Este hay que catarlo bien para opinar, de momento me ha parecido incluso m\\xc3\\xa1s duro/complicado que el Brass Lancashire (el cl\\xc3\\xa1sico), que ya es decir! Pero a la vez m\\xc3\\xa1s enrevesado y menos elegante. El mapa al ser m\\xc3\\xa1s grande deja m\\xc3\\xa1s espacio a los jugadores para construir y no est\\xc3\\xa1 todo tan re\\xc3\\xb1ido, eso es lo que menos me ha gustado. 2a partida, tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de edificios, el otro Brass mola m\\xc3\\xa1s, en este caso menos es m\\xc3\\xa1s, pero esta bien para variar. Ya le podr\\xc3\\xadan haber puesto un mapa distinto en la otra cara del tablero... Lo tengo con fundas premium.

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

rule book.  Not necessarily where you'd expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners.

The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

I never played the original Brass, and now I don&#039;t need to.  The art, mechanics, and pacing of the game is excellent.  I absolutely love the the &quot;tale of two halves&quot; type of mechanic that rewards preparation.  I have limited experience with Euro&#039;s, but this game has become my personal Euro litmus test. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4characters\" rating=\"5\">Meh, regular Brass or AoI is better for me, but I do like that the dumb foreign market is gone. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4ndroid\" rating=\"8\">upgraded components $79</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4rch3r\" rating=\"10\">&quot;Amazon und Puff&quot;\\n\\n@Domibi\\n\\n-sleeved (gamegenic matte)\\n-insert (folded space)\\n-3d printed minis\\n\\n*cplx 4</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"5mokus\" rating=\"6\">The game itself is not interesting enough to learn it&#039;s metagame.

Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!)

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos!

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos!

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

Also, it&#039;s terrible at demonstrating the possible value of different strategies, other than the general &quot;rail building&quot; path. Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!) But this game itself is under developed.\\n\\nExploring a game by playing it is fun, but  it&#039;s usually about learning how to do a strategy, and not finding out, how well a strategy preforms.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"6legsci\" rating=\"N/A\">Vault</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"72tigers\" rating=\"3\">Worker placememt</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"75dragon\" rating=\"7\">Beer</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaedien\" rating=\"N/A\">3pp, 4pp (2-4)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarkas\" rating=\"9\">Kickstarter</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AaronBE85\" rating=\"8.5\">X.TRS</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AbacoBilbao\" rating=\"N/A\">[Estante 08]\\n[M000143]</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abdul\" rating=\"9\">Excellent and highly interactive game. Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos! Este hay que catarlo bien para opinar, de momento me ha parecido incluso m\\xc3\\xa1s duro/complicado que el Brass Lancashire (el cl\\xc3\\xa1sico), que ya es decir! Pero a la vez m\\xc3\\xa1s enrevesado y menos elegante. El mapa al ser m\\xc3\\xa1s grande deja m\\xc3\\xa1s espacio a los jugadores para construir y no est\\xc3\\xa1 todo tan re\\xc3\\xb1ido, eso es lo que menos me ha gustado. 2a partida, tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de edificios, el otro Brass mola m\\xc3\\xa1s, en este caso menos es m\\xc3\\xa1s, pero esta bien para variar.

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era.

The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

You should have an idea of what you want to do (can\\'t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the \"Very tactical with strategy\" style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

I never played the original Brass, and now I don&#039;t need to.  The art, mechanics, and pacing of the game is excellent.

Also, it&#039;s terrible at demonstrating the possible value of different strategies, other than the general &quot;rail building&quot; path. Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!) But this game itself is under developed.\\n\\nExploring a game by playing it is fun, but  it&#039;s usually about learning how to do a strategy, and not finding out, how well a strategy preforms.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"6legsci\" rating=\"N/A\">Vault</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"72tigers\" rating=\"3\">Worker placememt</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"75dragon\" rating=\"7\">Beer</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaedien\" rating=\"N/A\">3pp, 4pp (2-4)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarkas\" rating=\"9\">Kickstarter</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AaronBE85\" rating=\"8.5\">X.TRS</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AbacoBilbao\" rating=\"N/A\">[Estante 08]\\n[M000143]</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abdul\" rating=\"9\">Excellent and highly interactive game. Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos! Este hay que catarlo bien para opinar, de momento me ha parecido incluso m\\xc3\\xa1s duro/complicado que el Brass Lancashire (el cl\\xc3\\xa1sico), que ya es decir! Pero a la vez m\\xc3\\xa1s enrevesado y menos elegante. El mapa al ser m\\xc3\\xa1s grande deja m\\xc3\\xa1s espacio a los jugadores para construir y no est\\xc3\\xa1 todo tan re\\xc3\\xb1ido, eso es lo que menos me ha gustado. 2a partida, tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de edificios, el otro Brass mola m\\xc3\\xa1s, en este caso menos es m\\xc3\\xa1s, pero esta bien para variar.

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

rule book.  Not necessarily where you'd expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners.

The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

I never played the original Brass, and now I don&#039;t need to.  The art, mechanics, and pacing of the game is excellent.  I absolutely love the the &quot;tale of two halves&quot; type of mechanic that rewards preparation.  I have limited experience with Euro&#039;s, but this game has become my personal Euro litmus test. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4characters\" rating=\"5\">Meh, regular Brass or AoI is better for me, but I do like that the dumb foreign market is gone. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4ndroid\" rating=\"8\">upgraded components $79</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4rch3r\" rating=\"10\">&quot;Amazon und Puff&quot;\\n\\n@Domibi\\n\\n-sleeved (gamegenic matte)\\n-insert (folded space)\\n-3d printed minis\\n\\n*cplx 4</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"5mokus\" rating=\"6\">The game itself is not interesting enough to learn it&#039;s metagame.

Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!)

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos!

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos!

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

Also, it&#039;s terrible at demonstrating the possible value of different strategies, other than the general &quot;rail building&quot; path. Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!) But this game itself is under developed.\\n\\nExploring a game by playing it is fun, but  it&#039;s usually about learning how to do a strategy, and not finding out, how well a strategy preforms.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"6legsci\" rating=\"N/A\">Vault</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"72tigers\" rating=\"3\">Worker placememt</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"75dragon\" rating=\"7\">Beer</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaedien\" rating=\"N/A\">3pp, 4pp (2-4)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarkas\" rating=\"9\">Kickstarter</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AaronBE85\" rating=\"8.5\">X.TRS</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AbacoBilbao\" rating=\"N/A\">[Estante 08]\\n[M000143]</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abdul\" rating=\"9\">Excellent and highly interactive game. Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos! Este hay que catarlo bien para opinar, de momento me ha parecido incluso m\\xc3\\xa1s duro/complicado que el Brass Lancashire (el cl\\xc3\\xa1sico), que ya es decir! Pero a la vez m\\xc3\\xa1s enrevesado y menos elegante. El mapa al ser m\\xc3\\xa1s grande deja m\\xc3\\xa1s espacio a los jugadores para construir y no est\\xc3\\xa1 todo tan re\\xc3\\xb1ido, eso es lo que menos me ha gustado. 2a partida, tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de edificios, el otro Brass mola m\\xc3\\xa1s, en este caso menos es m\\xc3\\xa1s, pero esta bien para variar.

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era.

The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

You should have an idea of what you want to do (can\\'t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the \"Very tactical with strategy\" style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

I never played the original Brass, and now I don&#039;t need to.  The art, mechanics, and pacing of the game is excellent.

Also, it&#039;s terrible at demonstrating the possible value of different strategies, other than the general &quot;rail building&quot; path. Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!) But this game itself is under developed.\\n\\nExploring a game by playing it is fun, but  it&#039;s usually about learning how to do a strategy, and not finding out, how well a strategy preforms.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"6legsci\" rating=\"N/A\">Vault</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"72tigers\" rating=\"3\">Worker placememt</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"75dragon\" rating=\"7\">Beer</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaedien\" rating=\"N/A\">3pp, 4pp (2-4)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarkas\" rating=\"9\">Kickstarter</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AaronBE85\" rating=\"8.5\">X.TRS</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AbacoBilbao\" rating=\"N/A\">[Estante 08]\\n[M000143]</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abdul\" rating=\"9\">Excellent and highly interactive game. Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos! Este hay que catarlo bien para opinar, de momento me ha parecido incluso m\\xc3\\xa1s duro/complicado que el Brass Lancashire (el cl\\xc3\\xa1sico), que ya es decir! Pero a la vez m\\xc3\\xa1s enrevesado y menos elegante. El mapa al ser m\\xc3\\xa1s grande deja m\\xc3\\xa1s espacio a los jugadores para construir y no est\\xc3\\xa1 todo tan re\\xc3\\xb1ido, eso es lo que menos me ha gustado. 2a partida, tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de edificios, el otro Brass mola m\\xc3\\xa1s, en este caso menos es m\\xc3\\xa1s, pero esta bien para variar.

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

rule book.  Not necessarily where you'd expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners.

The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

I never played the original Brass, and now I don&#039;t need to.  The art, mechanics, and pacing of the game is excellent.  I absolutely love the the &quot;tale of two halves&quot; type of mechanic that rewards preparation.  I have limited experience with Euro&#039;s, but this game has become my personal Euro litmus test. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4characters\" rating=\"5\">Meh, regular Brass or AoI is better for me, but I do like that the dumb foreign market is gone. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4ndroid\" rating=\"8\">upgraded components $79</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4rch3r\" rating=\"10\">&quot;Amazon und Puff&quot;\\n\\n@Domibi\\n\\n-sleeved (gamegenic matte)\\n-insert (folded space)\\n-3d printed minis\\n\\n*cplx 4</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"5mokus\" rating=\"6\">The game itself is not interesting enough to learn it&#039;s metagame.

Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!)

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos!

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos!

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

Also, it&#039;s terrible at demonstrating the possible value of different strategies, other than the general &quot;rail building&quot; path. Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!) But this game itself is under developed.\\n\\nExploring a game by playing it is fun, but  it&#039;s usually about learning how to do a strategy, and not finding out, how well a strategy preforms.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"6legsci\" rating=\"N/A\">Vault</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"72tigers\" rating=\"3\">Worker placememt</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"75dragon\" rating=\"7\">Beer</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaedien\" rating=\"N/A\">3pp, 4pp (2-4)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarkas\" rating=\"9\">Kickstarter</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AaronBE85\" rating=\"8.5\">X.TRS</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AbacoBilbao\" rating=\"N/A\">[Estante 08]\\n[M000143]</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abdul\" rating=\"9\">Excellent and highly interactive game. Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos! Este hay que catarlo bien para opinar, de momento me ha parecido incluso m\\xc3\\xa1s duro/complicado que el Brass Lancashire (el cl\\xc3\\xa1sico), que ya es decir! Pero a la vez m\\xc3\\xa1s enrevesado y menos elegante. El mapa al ser m\\xc3\\xa1s grande deja m\\xc3\\xa1s espacio a los jugadores para construir y no est\\xc3\\xa1 todo tan re\\xc3\\xb1ido, eso es lo que menos me ha gustado. 2a partida, tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de edificios, el otro Brass mola m\\xc3\\xa1s, en este caso menos es m\\xc3\\xa1s, pero esta bien para variar.

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era.

The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

You should have an idea of what you want to do (can\\'t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the \"Very tactical with strategy\" style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

I never played the original Brass, and now I don&#039;t need to.  The art, mechanics, and pacing of the game is excellent.

Also, it&#039;s terrible at demonstrating the possible value of different strategies, other than the general &quot;rail building&quot; path. Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!) But this game itself is under developed.\\n\\nExploring a game by playing it is fun, but  it&#039;s usually about learning how to do a strategy, and not finding out, how well a strategy preforms.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"6legsci\" rating=\"N/A\">Vault</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"72tigers\" rating=\"3\">Worker placememt</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"75dragon\" rating=\"7\">Beer</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"aaedien\" rating=\"N/A\">3pp, 4pp (2-4)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aarkas\" rating=\"9\">Kickstarter</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AaronBE85\" rating=\"8.5\">X.TRS</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AbacoBilbao\" rating=\"N/A\">[Estante 08]\\n[M000143]</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abdul\" rating=\"9\">Excellent and highly interactive game. Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos! Este hay que catarlo bien para opinar, de momento me ha parecido incluso m\\xc3\\xa1s duro/complicado que el Brass Lancashire (el cl\\xc3\\xa1sico), que ya es decir! Pero a la vez m\\xc3\\xa1s enrevesado y menos elegante. El mapa al ser m\\xc3\\xa1s grande deja m\\xc3\\xa1s espacio a los jugadores para construir y no est\\xc3\\xa1 todo tan re\\xc3\\xb1ido, eso es lo que menos me ha gustado. 2a partida, tampoco me ha gustado el exceso de edificios, el otro Brass mola m\\xc3\\xa1s, en este caso menos es m\\xc3\\xa1s, pero esta bien para variar.

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

rule book.  Not necessarily where you'd expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners.

The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

I never played the original Brass, and now I don&#039;t need to.  The art, mechanics, and pacing of the game is excellent.  I absolutely love the the &quot;tale of two halves&quot; type of mechanic that rewards preparation.  I have limited experience with Euro&#039;s, but this game has become my personal Euro litmus test. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4characters\" rating=\"5\">Meh, regular Brass or AoI is better for me, but I do like that the dumb foreign market is gone. </comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4ndroid\" rating=\"8\">upgraded components $79</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"4rch3r\" rating=\"10\">&quot;Amazon und Puff&quot;\\n\\n@Domibi\\n\\n-sleeved (gamegenic matte)\\n-insert (folded space)\\n-3d printed minis\\n\\n*cplx 4</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"5mokus\" rating=\"6\">The game itself is not interesting enough to learn it&#039;s metagame.

Sadly that&#039;s one of the best point source in a 4 player game. \\n\\nLack of game balance and play-testing is an issue. The game is mechanically solid, (It has some beautiful interactions!)

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos!

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&lt;br/&gt;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&lt;br/&gt;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&lt;br/&gt;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&lt;br/&gt;5) Loan - Take a &amp;pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New &amp;quot;Sell&amp;quot; system&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &amp;quot;grease the wheels of industry&amp;quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &amp;pound;8 per cube, and it\\'s not uncommon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thumbnail>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg</thumbnail>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<image>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg</image>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgameaccessory objectid=\"334571\">Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reDrewno Insert</boardgameaccessory>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepublisher objectid=\"21765\">Roxley</boardgamepublisher>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<boardgamepodcastepisode objectid=\"205004\">#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap;

ironed out some oddities of the original game.\\nFortunes change frequently, so the winner could be anyone.\\n\\nMinus points:\\nThe board and card artwork is generally too dark (even on the light side of the board), making it hard for some people to see detail clearly, especially under artificial lights in the evening.\\nThe rules are all in the rule book.  Not necessarily where you&#039;d expect to find them though.\\nThe addition of beer, manufactured goods and pottery is a double edged sword:  Nice to have variety but makes things harder to grasp for new players and even experienced players.\\nWe found the need for beer to get most things done annoying. Needing coal and iron was already obstacle enough.\\nLots of fiddly network/connection rules that everyone forgot at some point, necessitating a lot of reversing what you&#039;ve just done in order to replace it with something legal.\\nAP really set in over the last half a dozen turns as we scrutinized the whole board and our last remaining cards to try to spot final scoring opportunities. Everyone was affected, so the game slowed down a lot, sucking the fun out of it with so much downtime. The last couple of turns had so much AP delay that I went away to fold laundry for a while.\\n\\nOverall I&#039;d play it again but I prefer Brass Lancashire.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"2d20\" rating=\"9\">Brilliant! \\nFits right into my wheelhouse all around and game weight.

Probably the best realisation of market supply and demand in a board game. Every action another player takes has a major influence on your strategy and the decisions you will make, from deficiencies in the resource market waiting to be filled up, new trade networks being established, or precious beer becoming available to guzzle down. Opportunities are primarily player driven and you have to keep your strategy flexible enough to take advantage of what others are doing. \\n\\nEverything about the design is so well crafted and gives your decision making so many more layers. The hand management, turn order manipulation based on your spending, the appropriately thematic change from canal era to rail era, these elements all work together to make Brass greater than the sum of its parts. \\n\\nThe rules are complex and it can take a play or two to internalise the systems, and the Roxley production is very pretty, but sacrifices usability with the overly dark board and hard to see canal/rail links. But these are minor nitpicks that will not stop me from playing this masterpiece.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aberdeen1977\" rating=\"9\">25-02-2019 (175)</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Abinrml\" rating=\"N/A\">KS Deluxe Edition</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"abirch123\" rating=\"9\">The absolute best game I&#039;ve ever played.

The beer slows down the trading path, by adding a layer. The trading ports themselves are great, it creates a fresh, varied state for the map positioning with each new play, a great addition. I think that option alone may make this better than the original. The pottery is somewhat equivalent to the shipyards.\\n\\nDISLIKE: More nuances, so it increases the play time slightly, more analysis paralysis. Still fiddly as ever. Many corner case rules, so many that I find it difficult to remember them all unless another player is familiar with the rules as well.\\n\\nOVERALL: Love it. Our first game took about 4 hours. It seems there could be more strategies with this version. I am now interested in Age of Industry to see if there is a way to get the playtime down.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamsalem\" rating=\"N/A\">Box 3</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamscott\" rating=\"7\">After two plays of Lancashire and now one of Birmingham, I&#039;m not too sure what to make of these games.  They are deep, thinky and very interactive. On the other hand, they are very AP inducing (perhaps more than any other game I&#039;ve played), the rules are &#039;quirky&#039; and the card play feels odd to me.  \\n\\nThis feels more like a variant than a standalone game.  I think the changes are an improvement and this is the better version.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"adamxt\" rating=\"9\">There is something pretty special about Brass: Birmingham. Though the rules are pretty complex and fiddly at the beginning (especially networks and the way coal is different from everything else), but this leads to an immense depth of play. The cards are a wonderful constraint and will drive you to rage. At higher player counts, the opportunities to disrupt each other in horrifying ways become more and more frequent.\\n\\nIt also actually feels like a simulation, instead of an exercise in number crunching. The beer element might feel a bit tacked on, but it is easily explained away and is necessary to add that final &quot;oomf&quot; to the strategy.\\n\\nOne of the deepest and cleanest economic simulations I&#039;ve played, though it might not look very clean the first time you play. Highly recommended for some crunchy industrialization action!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Adanedhel\" rating=\"9.5\">Primera partida a 4, que complicado subir los niveles de las construcciones, y hay muchos!

The basic mechanics are the same still. However since there are more types of industry, players have more options for specialising. In other words, this translates to an increased number of fundamental basic strategies than in the original. The downside is that the competition can be less cutthroat and there are more rules to explain. \\n\\nAnother change in the game is that links no longer score on the basis of the number of industry it connects. Instead the industries have a specific link value (0-2 VP) thus complicating the things a bit.\\n\\nI really cannot decide between this and the original. This may offer more variation from game to game but rules are more elegant in the original (although badly written which just happens to be Wallace\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trademark).</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">See my review here (spoiler alert: it is great, and works excellent with 2 players) - https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2738568/game-lunar-society-birmingham-would-play-boardgame</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AdelinDumitru\" rating=\"10\">Oh man, having to choose between this and Lancashire is so difficult!

It&#039;s really not as tough to teach as the weight it&#039;s given. Make sure to watch the how to play video by &#039;watch it played&#039; on youtube. I also recommend the player aids in the files section of BGG. With both of those things done first, it took my play group about 20 minutes to get going. Some of the rules are a bit arbitrary and hard to remember, but after one play through you should have the hang of it.\\n\\nIt&#039;s an intriguing game of give and takes. It&#039;s mostly resource management and strategic placement to set yourself up for big future turns. It also requires quick thinking on your feet because it&#039;s very easy to get your plan squashed by your opponents progress. \\n\\nEvery system in the game is well designed and thought out. You&#039;ll be surprised as you play at how connected everything is. I soon realized that it&#039;s impossible to focus on everything. You&#039;ll have to utilize your opponent&#039;s resources and infrastructure to advance your goals. \\n\\nMany games remove all &#039;take-that&#039; mechanics where your actions can negatively impact other players. Brass: Birmingham takes a refreshing look at meddling with your opponents: they can gain victory points and upgrades when you steal their stuff, so you will have to weigh every decision. \\n\\nI found that I also took all of the types of actions all throughout the game. There was never a bland moment, especially with the two phases of the game keeping it fresh.\\n\\nOverall, probably the best strategy board game I have ever played!</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"After45\" rating=\"10\">I expected this to be a once-in-a-blue-moon game that&#039;s fun for hardcore boardgamers, but the simplicity of the engine mixed with the feeling of steady progress as your strategies get better and better with each play makes it a banger game that&#039;s a permanent addition to my collection.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Aftonkatt\" rating=\"9.7\">Historic hand management economic engine</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Ag0n1st\" rating=\"9\">Meeple Realty Wood Insert\\nGamegenic Gray Card Sleeves</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AG19\" rating=\"N/A\">Wonderful game.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can&#039;t wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can&#039;t reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn&#039;t need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agent_Pendergast\" rating=\"10\">Top 5 Favorite Game of All Time</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"Agguire\" rating=\"10\">Outstanding</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ahalm\" rating=\"10\">The best game that excists, no doubt.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"AhBest\" rating=\"N/A\">TH version</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"ailouros\" rating=\"7\">Well designed and playable euro game, but nothing more.

It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one&#039;s income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player&#039;s VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren&#039;t enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry.

I&#039;ll still play it if someone is really keen on it, but I would rather play Via Nebula (Brass Lite in 45-60 min) or a different game for 2-3 hours.\\n\\n\\nVery interesting Euro, with both tactics and strategy required.  Players need to use their opponents&#039; resources and connections, but using them too much negates the benefit.  You should have an idea of what you want to do (can&#039;t do everything, so formulate an idea ahead of time) but you absolutely need to react to the board or else your strategy will fizzle.\\n\\nMost of the rules were quickly internalized as they were intuitive, although setup was long.  The first round of each half of the game takes forever and a day, as the options are either wide open (first round) or extremely isolated (second half).\\n\\nI enjoyed the &quot;Very tactical with strategy&quot; style of gameplay and would find ways to get it played.\\n\\nI ended up selling this, not because I dislike it or that no one will play it with me, but because the people who would play it with me all own it.  Selling it reduces my shelf size and does not impact my opportunities to play this at all.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akahdrin\" rating=\"10\">This game is borderline flawless.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akikone\" rating=\"8.5\">Very tightly competitive game, network building is fun and the economy is solid.</comment>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<comment username=\"akiracrosshair\" rating=\"9\">Very very good, hardcore euro-game.

Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<br/><br/>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<br/><br/>1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br/>2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.<br/>3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br/>4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br/>5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:<br/><br/>6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)<br/><br/>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<br/><br/>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<br/><br/>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.<br/><br/>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<br/><br/>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<br/><br/>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:<br/><br/>Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<br/><br/>Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<br/><br/>Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<br/><br/>Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.<br/><br/>Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<br/><br/>\", 'thumbnail': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__thumb/img/o18rjEemoWaVru9Y2TyPwuIaRfE=/fit-in/200x150/filters:strip_icc()/pic3490053.jpg', 'image': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/x3zxjr-Vw5iU4yDPg70Jgw__original/img/FpyxH41Y6_ROoePAilPNEhXnzO8=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic3490053.jpg', 'boardgameaccessory': [{'@objectid': '334571', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – reDrewno Insert'}, {'@objectid': '373838', '#text': 'Brass Birmingham: Spike Craft Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347851', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Eurohell Design Insert'}, {'@objectid': '306354', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham / Lancashire – Folded Space Insert'}, {'@objectid': '350761', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Dicetroyers Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '309493', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – e-Raptor Insert'}, {'@objectid': '347407', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Game Tamer Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '339385', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – Laserox Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '348604', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – The GiftForge Insert'}, {'@objectid': '340345', '#text': 'Brass: Birmingham – TowerRex Organizer'}, {'@objectid': '328775', '#text': 'Brass: Coin-Cases'}, {'@objectid': '349935', '#text': 'Brass: Eurohell Design 3D Locomotive & Barge Upgrade'}, {'@objectid': '268234', '#text': 'Brass: Meeple Realty Insert'}, {'@objectid': '233281', '#text': 'Iron Clays'}], 'boardgamepublisher': [{'@objectid': '21765', '#text': 'Roxley'}, {'@objectid': '3475', '#text': 'Arclight Games'}, {'@objectid': '25074', '#text': 'BoardM Factory'}, {'@objectid': '21608', '#text': 'CMON Global Limited'}, {'@objectid': '11043', '#text': 'Conclave Editora'}, {'@objectid': '34522', '#text': 'CrowD Games'}, {'@objectid': '31071', '#text': 'Dexker Games'}, {'@objectid': '8832', '#text': 'Funforge'}, {'@objectid': '8820', '#text': 'Gém Klub Kft.'}, {'@objectid': '4785', '#text': 'Ghenos Games'}, {'@objectid': '42147', '#text': 'Giant Roc'}, {'@objectid': '36210', '#text': 'Lanlalen'}, {'@objectid': '46500', '#text': 'Lord of Boards'}, {'@objectid': '30677', '#text': 'Maldito Games'}, {'@objectid': '36186', '#text': 'PHALANX'}, {'@objectid': '7466', '#text': 'Rebel Sp. z o.o.'}, {'@objectid': '41423', '#text': 'TLAMA games'}], 'boardgamepodcastepisode': [{'@objectid': '205004', '#text': '#44: Anachrony six-pack review and on tap; Fugitive; Valeria Card Kingdoms; Veggie Garden'}, {'@objectid': '276930', '#text': '#54: Talon and Table Talk'}, {'@objectid': '286111', '#text': '#63: Hype Men'}, {'@objectid': '390312', '#text': '12: Fun in the Sun (Beyond the Sun, Brass, Robinson Crusoe)'}, {'@objectid': '468697', '#text': 'BGT056 - BGG Top 100: Brass'}, {'@objectid': '449677', '#text': 'DDP 85.

There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game.

Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability.

       "  '#text': \"This is one of the few games in the bgg top 10 that definitely deserves it. There is something about this game that is really hard to put into words on why it is so great. It is one of those games that you can't wait until your turn to execute some clever maneuvers that are pretty rewarding when pulled off. Partially because they reward you with income for the rest of the game and also it establishes some resources that everyone can use. There is so much cleverness built into every aspect of the game in the card system of discarding the same cards you use to build, into the cards being able to built at locations or specific types of buildings. The buildings themselves as sort of a tech tree of of different resource costs, money costs, end game points, and income. There are several different strategies to pursue and some of that will change from game to game because of the market tiles but really the variability comes from the cards themselves as you can only do what they tell you. The card distribution is interesting because some cards are more important than others and ones you might want to hang onto. The scoring is great because it rewards you for building rails as well as buildings so you really want to excel with both. The flow of the game is perfect as the first round you are really working hard to get something going, laying down rails, getting some buildings out, then all the sudden all the level 1 buildings go away but your network is still in place and you can really ramp up in the second era. It can be very difficult to get started because you often might find you need to take a loan which feels counter to most games you play where that is a bad thing. The artwork and components are top notch, nice linen finish on everything with a small box that really packs everything in. A few complaints would be no player aid which is really unfortunate for some a nice production and you have to rely on the community to understand the different actions. Towards the end of the game you get it but the player aid that comes with it is just a few works and the community just showed me what could have been. I imagine the iron clays are incredible if you get those but the standard cardboard money is just fine. I also dislike that we do have to put the money on the turn order track because it can be a little fiddly to stack, you often can't reach that side of the board, and keeping it near the players can be problematic remembering which pile is what. I wish there was some way to emulate that mechanism while putting that money back in the bank with some sort of numbered tile, or a cube on a numbered track, or something else. The day/night board is an interesting choice it is interesting that it is there I guess for visibility but I wish it was better utilized as some form of extra content in the game... but it probably doesn't need it. There is definitely some setup time sorting and fiddlying with those player tokens which can probably only be solved with a plano or tons of little baggies. The player turn times can also be long as some actions cause a big chain reaction while already giving you a lot to think about. Coupled with the fact that turn order is determined by who spent the least means some players can take 4 actions in a row and take quite a long time. I imagine at higher player counts it is definitely more interaction because of the shared world but man those turns could take forever to come around. For us it is perfect at two because we can take awhile and enjoy the game and discuss as we are going. It is hard to write about games you enjoy because ranting comes so easy, but it is just a fine tuned engine of a game. Everything that exists is there to push you without fluff.\"},\n",

       "  '#text': \"Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass: Lancashire by Martin Wallace (Railways of the World, AuZtralia, Wildlands). It is a card-driven hand management game in the Industrial Age. Players build the infrastructure (industries and routes) to produce and ship resources for money and victory points.\\n\\n[b]What makes it special?[/b]\\n\\n* Tight intertwined system: hand management, creating and connecting industries, money and income management\\n* Synergy between players: players benefit from resources and networks of other players (players build a mutual board and use what each other has made)\\n* 2 eras that reset the game to some degree at the halfway mark of the game\\n\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n\\n+ Artwork\\nBeautiful map, industry tiles, and cards, good iconography, table presence\\n\\n+ Theme\\nIndustrial Age, historic, capitalism, economic, England. The game is more about mechanics and strategies than telling stories.\\n\\n+ Components\\nDouble sided boards: day or night, standard wooden cubes for coal and iron, custom wooden beer barrels, high quality tokens, cards, and player boards\\n\\n+ Many paths to victory\\nShip cotton, manufacturing goods, pottery (focus on one vs mix of all). Provide coal, iron, and/or beer. Build links for additional points. Race for boni for being the first who delivers to the markets.\\n\\n+ Two eras (similar, but different)\\nThe game is split into two eras each triggers scoring. After the first canal era, all level 1 industries are removed and make space for new buildings. Building industries higher than level 1 in the first canal era, let you score them twice (efficiency play). Moreover, all canal links are removed and must be rebuild with more expensive rail links. Each era ends if all cards have been played. \\n\\n+ The develop action (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nThe develop action lets you get rid of low level industry tiles but it costs an action and iron. It is useful to build higher level industries in the first canal era to score them twice.\\n\\n+ Network building (optimal routes and scoring)\\nLinks are build to connect locations used to consume coal/beer, buy/sell coal, ship goods, or score victory points. First canals then replaced by more expensive rails. All players build up the infrastructure which is also used by all players (synergy). Each location has limited spots for different industries tiles. It creates deep decision-making: how to connect locations/industries to consume coal/beer and to ship to the next available market? Moreover, each player can only build one industry tile per location in the first canal era (very restrictive). Building new links may benefit the other players but also provides one player with victory points for all the adjacent flipped industry tiles (clever incentive to still build links)\\n\\n+ Driven by hand management with multi-used cards (complex decision-making, options vs restrictions, timing)\\nEach player has a hand limit of 8 cards. Players play 2 cards per turn (except for the first round). Cards show either a location or industry. Locations are useful to build one of the printed industries in that location and to spread around the map. Industry cards are useful to build a specific type of industry tile on an already connected(!) location. At the end of a round, players draw 2 cards. The cards in your hand provide you a lot of options and restrictions at the same time (can be mitigated by wild cards).\\n\\n+ Wild cards (flexibility)\\nA player may discard 3 cards to take one wild location card and one wild industry card that can be use anywhere (flexibility)\\n\\n+ Discard any card for various actions (flexibility)\\nA player can discard any card for various other actions: develop canals or railroads, take a loan, ship goods, develop to upgrade (remove) industry tiles from player board, or pass.\\n\\n+ Timing (immediate benefit vs efficiency)\\nOne discarded card can be used for huge turns where a player ships to multiple different locations. Efficiency balancing act: wait or ship to gain at least some benefit/income from now to the rest of the game? Will there be enough resource left next turn?\\n\\n[-]+ Victory point track is also used to define how much income the players get[/-]\\n\\n+ Loans for instant cash income (flexibility)\\nLoans reduce one's income level to get instant 30$. Loans are never paid back, instead your income per round is decreased and may also become negative. \\n\\n+ Resource management (coal, iron, and bear)\\nIron can be consumed from any industry tile on the board. Coal can only be consumed from an industry tile if there is a link or if there is a link to a market (distant port) location (unintuitive, network building, synergy)\\n\\n+ Dynamic common market for resources (flexibility, money or cost generator)\\nPlayers can buy or sell iron and coal if there are no resources on any industry tiles on the board. Creates flexibility: but costs money when buying or gain money when selling). Buying or selling coal (not iron) requires a link to any market (unintuitive)\\n\\n+ Shipping goods to flip industry tiles (scoring)\\nShipped or cleared tiles (by any player) will flip an industry tile (of any player). Flipped industry tiles increase the income, add links used to score connected locations, and provide victory points at the end of an era (synergy)\\n\\n+ Need for beer to ship goods (additional layer)\\nBeer is additionally needed to either ship crates, cottons mills, and pottery (adds an additional requirement / layer to think about) or to build two rail links at once (costs vs efficiency)\\n\\n+ Balance of upgrading buildings: lower level building provide money, higher level buildings provide victory points\\n\\n+ Turn order by spent money\\nIt is defined by the least amount of money spent by each player in a round. E.g., each player has two actions. If a player uses the second action to build a new link, the next player may be the first to benefit from it. Moreover, a player may end a round and start the next round which allows four undisturbed actions in a row (strategic, careful planning)\\n\\n+ Random set-up (variability, replayability)\\nDemand tokens on the market locations makes each game play differently\\n\\n+ Helpful player boards \\nShow all the information for upgrading buildings, cubes and money (clears up the tiles compared to the old version of Brass: Lancashire)\\n\\n+ Clarity\\nClear player boards, player aids, and iconography (most rules reminders are printed on the boards in form of iconography). Resources provide a good visual feedback of the current state.\\n\\n+ Motivating game arc (escalation)\\nRestrictive one building per player in each location in the first canal era. Building links in the beginning of an era. Escalation of income and industries in the second rail era.\\n\\n+ Scales well with all player counts (but still better with 3-4 players)\\n\\n+ Complex interaction but still accessible (artwork and streamlined mechanisms)\\n\\n+ Brief, well written rules (12 pages)\\nHowever, no gameplay examples and the interconnected actions result in a lot of referencing for beginners. The rules are missing some important information (see below)\\n\\n+ Game box has a nice plastic insert\\n\\n[b]Neutrals:[/b]\\n\\n# The crate/manufacturing good is very generic / abstract\\n\\n# Language independent (only names of cities on the cards and board)\\n\\n# High player interaction due to different synergy effects\\n\\n# Sandbox game (no specific objectives for the players)\\n\\n# Some hidden information (cards in hands of the other players)\\n\\n# Luck of the draw for cards\\n\\n# Locations are color-coded on the map and cards \\nHelps to find a location, however, it still takes a couple of plays to find your way around Birmingham\\n\\n# Heavy, complex, thinking game (high potential for analysis paralysis and downtime - not for everyone!)\\n\\n# Deluxe edition \\nHas poker chips for money instead of cardboard tokens, thicker cardboard, there is no exclusive game content (+). The delivered box was extremely well packed (+)\\n\\n# Quick comparison to Brass: Lancashire\\nNo distant market and no ports which are replaced by 5 unique locations, no ships replaced by pottery, random goods on random location for shipping, beer needed for 3 types of industries in order to sell, players can sell to as many different locations as they want (flexibility), new links to score victory points (symbols on tiles and locations), scout action replace wild cards, simplified loans (only 30$), bigger coal/iron market, little more complex player board\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n\\n- Potentially overwhelming\\nThe rules are not complicated but the high, interconnected complexity and sandbox-style of the game may be overwhelming for some/most people: the side-effects of actions are not that intuitive, especially for beginners. How to consume coal vs iron vs beer and what links are required?\\n\\n- Bothersome exchange of money tokens (discipline)\\nDo not directly pay money to the bank (important to keep track of player order, but still annoying). However, you will get use to it.\\n\\n(-) Setting up the player boards \\nPlacing all the industry tiles on the player board takes some time, however, there is not much else to set-up.\\n\\n- Confusing shared tracks for victory points and income \\n[i]A player's VP and Income markers are not distinguishable enough from each other. As they share the same track, when in proximity to each other, their different shapes aren't enough to alleviate getting confused between the two.[/i] (thanks to Barry Miller)\\n\\n[b]Thoughts:[/b]\\n\\nBrass: Birmingham is an unique economic game with great production value, high synergistic player interaction, and crunchy decision-making. The cards in your hand give you a lot of options but also restrictions. Depending on your cards, you have to figure out what to build next and how to maximize your own benefit without helping the other players too much - this somehow reminds me of Five Tribes. Managing money, resources, industries, links, and timing is a very difficult balancing act. Brass: Birmingham offers an intertwined, complex system that comes with very few rules. It is a fascinating achievement in terms of game design and the reason why it is my game of the year 2018!\\n\\n[b]Similar games:[/b]\\n\\n* Brass: Lancashire / Age of Industry\\nVery similar gameplay, a little less layers and variability. More unforgiving, because every decision counts. Different available maps for Age of Industry. Both games by Martin Wallace.\\n\\n* On Mars\\nSynergistic player interaction, a lot of options, less streamlined, steep learning curve.\\n\\n* Autobahn\\nSynergistic network building plus pick up and delivery with Concordia-style hand management.\\n\\n* Railways of the World\\nLess complex, focus on route building, some synergy via route sharing, simpler supply and demand for delivering goods, loans and income, event cards (more randomness), auctions for player order, by Martin Wallace.\\n\\n* Wildcatters\\nSynergistic network building with cut-throat denying of oil barrels or shares.\\n\\n* Imperial Steam\\n\\n[b]Missing rules:[/b]\\n\\n* What happens if you run out of iron cubes? https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2028859/lack-orange-iron-cubes\\n* How to draw cards at the start of the rail era? https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2031687/draw-8-cards-start-rail-era\"},\n",

       "\"Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass. Brass: Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.&#10;&#10;As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.&#10;&#10;Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):&#10;&#10;1) Build - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.&#10;2) Network - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.&#10;3) Develop - Increase the VP value of an industry.&#10;4) Sell - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.&#10;5) Loan - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham also features a new sixth action:&#10;&#10;6) Scout - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)&#10;&#10;The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.&#10;&#10;Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original Brass as well as in Brass: Birmingham.&#10;&#10;New &quot;Sell&quot; system&#10;&#10;Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.&#10;&#10;Birmingham features three all-new industry types:&#10;&#10;Brewery - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.&#10;&#10;Manufactured goods - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.&#10;&#10;Pottery - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.&#10;&#10;Increased Coal and Iron Market size - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.&#10;&#10;Brass: Birmingham is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.&#10;&#10;\""

to Martin Wallace\\' 2007 masterpiece, <em>Brass<\\\\/em>. <em>Brass: Birmingham<\\\\/em> tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>1) <strong>Build<\\\\/strong> - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br \\\\/>\\\\n2) <strong>Network<\\\\/strong> - Add a rail \\\\/ canal link, expanding your network.<br \\\\/>\\\\n3) <strong>Develop<\\\\/strong> - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br \\\\/>\\\\n4) <strong>Sell<\\\\/strong> - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br \\\\/>\\\\n5) <strong>Loan<\\\\/strong> - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham<\\\\/em> also features a new sixth action:<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>6) <strong>Scout<\\\\/strong> - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original <em>Brass<\\\\/em>.)<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><em>Birmingham<\\\\/em> features dynamic scoring canals\\\\/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original <em>Brass<\\\\/em> as well as in <em>Brass: Birmingham<\\\\/em>.<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<\\\\/strong><\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><em>Birmingham<\\\\/em> features three all-new industry types:<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong>Brewery<\\\\/strong> - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<\\\\/p>\\\\n\\\\n<p><strong>Manufactured goods<\\\\/strong> - Function like cotton, but features eight levels.

sequel to Martin Wallace\\\\\\' 2007 masterpiece, <em>Brass<\\\\\\\\/em>. <em>Brass: Birmingham<\\\\\\\\/em> tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution, between the years of 1770-1870.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort to exploit low or high market demands.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following actions (found in the original game):<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>1) <strong>Build<\\\\\\\\/strong> - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.<br \\\\\\\\/>\\\\\\\\n2) <strong>Network<\\\\\\\\/strong> - Add a rail \\\\\\\\/ canal link, expanding your network.<br \\\\\\\\/>\\\\\\\\n3) <strong>Develop<\\\\\\\\/strong> - Increase the VP value of an industry.<br \\\\\\\\/>\\\\\\\\n4) <strong>Sell<\\\\\\\\/strong> - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.<br \\\\\\\\/>\\\\\\\\n5) <strong>Loan<\\\\\\\\/strong> - Take a &pound;30 loan and reduce your income.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham<\\\\\\\\/em> also features a new sixth action:<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>6) <strong>Scout<\\\\\\\\/strong> - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original <em>Brass<\\\\\\\\/em>.)<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870). To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and established (flipped) industry tiles.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><em>Birmingham<\\\\\\\\/em> features dynamic scoring canals\\\\\\\\/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static 1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy with industry placement.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Iron, coal, and cotton are three industries which appear in both the original <em>Brass<\\\\\\\\/em> as well as in <em>Brass: Birmingham<\\\\\\\\/em>.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><strong>New &quot;Sell&quot; system<\\\\\\\\/strong><\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also &quot;grease the wheels of industry&quot; by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><em>Birmingham<\\\\\\\\/em> features three all-new industry types:<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><strong>Brewery<\\\\\\\\/strong> - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell goods.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><strong>Manufactured goods<\\\\\\\\/strong> - Function like cotton, but features eight levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs, making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><strong>Pottery<\\\\\\\\/strong> - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at a huge cost and need to plan.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><strong>Increased Coal and Iron Market size<\\\\\\\\/strong> - The price of coal and iron can now go up to &pound;8 per cube, and it\\\\\\'s not uncommon.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n<p><em>Brass: Birmingham<\\\\\\\\/em> is a sequel to Brass. It offers a very different story arc and experience from its predecessor.<\\\\\\\\/p>\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\",\"wiki\":\"<strong>Components:<\\\\\\\\/strong><br \\\\\\\\/>\\\\\\\\n<ul>\\\\\\\\n    <li> 1 Game board (double sided -

It\\'s not really a game (more like a parody of card games), but it\\'s funny with a good crowd.\\n\\nPlayers take turns drawing and then playing a card. If you have blank cards, you can just make one up and draw it and play it. It doesn\\'t work as a competitive game, but it\\'s fun if you just try to make up the coolest/goofiest/funniest/weirdest cards or cards that make other people do funny things. When I played, it kind of dragged on after everyone used up their funniest ideas and then someone threw down an \"I WIN\" card to end the game.

       "    'comment': 'Simply awesome. The unique special abilities are sort of lame, but that\\'s the only thing in the game I think could have been better (OK, the board is a bit too static, too). The traps, the bits, the simplicity and intuitiveness of the rules are all amazing.\\n\\nThe way that everyone can possibly lose the game is a great feature that I always enjoy in games; it makes victory just that much sweeter. The artwork is really great, too. Sort of reminds me of a more modern DungeonQuest style game.\\n\\nIt\\'s just screaming for an expansion. One easy way to introduce new traps would be to make trap rooms that are the same size as the 3 on the board (the crushing wall room, the lava room, and the river/chasm room) that you can lay over the trap rooms on the board. Of course, you could just make entirely new boards, too. A list of possible variants or small pieces added to the board would be easiest, though.\\n\\nSome ideas I\\'m thinking of:\\n-Jumping into the river requires a similar check to getting out, only you just have to ditch 3 treasures on a roll of 1. You can\\'t die jumping in.\\n-All 4 trap glyphs are visible for 20 seconds or so at the start of the game, before they are turned face down.\\n-Draw 3 wall cards, first turn, 4 the next, 5 the next, and then 6 on the 4th turn.\\n-The space north of the bridge is a \"slip\\'n slide\" that moves you one space towards the exit for free.\\n-The boulder moves 1 space minimum, and the 6 treasure is really worth 9.\\n\\nLack of replayability is an issue, since the game starts feeling repetitive or samey after repeat plays.'},\n",

Makes a great story as you play that is remembered long after the game ends. There are two phases of the game: first, players explore a haunted house and find weird items and have spooky things happen to them. Second, someone turns evil and the players play out one of the scenarios in the haunt books. The haunts can be very one-sided for either the good guys or the traitor, depending on how the exploration part of the game went. It's pretty random and sometimes has incomplete or ambiguous rules; fortunately, the errata is available online. Must play for Halloween.\\n\\nMy copy has been edited quite a bit. The haunt books have been updated to match the revised books, and some of the haunts have been edited further. The underground lake tile and the event where you get an item through the mirror have both been fixed, too.\"},\n",

I rule that landing on a blank space slides you forward to the next space, so you always do [i]something[/i] on your turn.\\n\\nFinding the 3 matching clues is both a time-intensive headache, and boringly easy to guess the answer to. For a better game, pick a handful of random clues and stick them around the board. Have your child try to figure out what they mean. This can have hilarious results, AND it stimulates creativity amIright?\"},\n",

I don't play it often though, because it just isn't fun if both players aren't at relatively the same skill level.  I'll play this when I'm in the mood for an intellectual exercise; but when I want relaxed fun, I'll play something else. That said, the game is very much a classic that is very traditional and a part of our culture, and I think it is a very good game to know how to play well. With a chess clock and a short time limit for each player (i.e. Speed Chess), the game is INTENSE and way fun!\"},\n",

The minis are very nice, too.\\n\\nRules-wise, it's very easy to learn or teach others, with not too much stuff the marines have to remember or keep track of. The dice combat is a simple and cool way to show damage, ammo usage, and range, all in one roll. Monster spawning is a bit gamey-feeling, but at least it makes more sense in DOOM than in DESCENT.\\n\\nMany complaints about the game can be fixed by making a scenario to your liking (with more ammo, less rooms, or whatever).\"},\n",

The game does a good job of keeping all the players together and the race is always really close and tense to the end. The coolest kid's game I've ever seen!\"},\n",

       "    'comment': 'I own both the original Fireball Island and this new one. The old one was a roll-and-move race game with take-that cardplay, and while the new one modernized the gameplay mechanics, it manages to feel even more random than the original classic. The player tokens and souvenir cards make the new one feel more like a theme park inspired by the old one, and the set collection for victory points aspect of the game really take away the incentive to fight over the Heart of Vulkar, which now feels like a little optional side treasure that is only worth picking up if it isn\\'t too far out of your way. Also, picking one out of 2 action cards a turn that dictate your move and when you can fireball people really feels like you have much less control than just rolling a die to move and collecting special cards that let you move players around or fireball people when you actually want to. And people fall down too easily on the flimsy board. I know remaking the same board that the original game had would be prohibitively expensive today, but the board quality is just not good enough for how it is supposed to be used in the game. It\\'s kind of fun in the same way that watching a marble run is fun, but suffers from pointless \"modernization\" that tries to fix some of what made the original game fun.'},\n",

       "    'comment': 'Very cool and fun puzzle-ish game where you have to build your space ship, and then go out and try to make money while not getting blasted to pieces. It has cool little space dude pieces, nice looking cards, and a cool theme. It\\'s great fun going out and exploring deep space, finding planets with goods on them or possibly pirates that will attack you and destroy sections of your ship. You have to try to take home the most valuable cargo while fighting off pirates, slavers, and asteroids, and get back before the other players. I\\'ve played a couple other puzzle-type games before, but GT was by far the most entertaining, probably in part due to the theme. Though you know what most of the upcoming cards will be, the game has a nice \\'exploration\\' type feeling to it. Seeing your ship be torn to pieces, but still cruise along through space and barely survive is cool and exciting.\\n\\nThe \"Combat zone\" cards or whatever they are called probably do a good job of simulating everybody getting caught in some kind of battle (some interstellar war going on or something?) and the weakest player get thrashed, but the \"combat zone\" cards don\\'t give any context or anything, so I was left thinking, \"What is happening here? Are we fighting each other? Are we all being attacked or something?\" That card could of been done better.\\n\\nThe only other thing I can think of that would make the game way cooler would be some pasted-on Star Wars theme or something like that. Each player is a smuggler who is building/fitting their transport and trying to pick up illegal goods and make it back to Nar Shadda or wherever the start planet is to sell their stuff. Bounty Hunters, Imperials, Mynocks/space slugs, and local law enforcement try to blow you up. Throw in places like Kessel, Tatooine, etc., give the goods more flavor, like spice, weapons, stuff like that. I always called the brown aliens Wookies anyway; they should be Wookies!\\n\\nJust a thought.'},\n",

I can imagine the witches visiting Ankh Morpork, but not these folks.\\n-If we're watchmen, why aren't we working together, why can we get arrested, and why do we have to charm other watchmen just like other volunteers? Why do we have to buy a watchman's badge at a merchant's shop to avoid getting arrested?\\n-The board doesn't match the layout of Ankh Morpork very well at all, but I understand it was probably made fairly symetrical to make all the start points pretty much equal.\"},\n",

What makes it cool is that it has fantasy things, the Men in Black, army dudes, robots, and samurai, ALL IN ONE!!!  How cool is that? I could probably use my warhammer40k minis for this, too. This game would be great for anyone who would like a miniature wargame that is light, easy, relatively short and inexpensive, and doesn't require arts and crafts skills (or just doesn't have the time for it, anymore).\"},\n",

       "    'comment': \"I have the Hasbro edition. This game is similar to Risk, with key differences being that the it uses victory points to determine a winner, and each player plays a number of historic civilizations throughout the game. All players are playing until the end, it has an epic civilization-building theme, and the game has a 7 turn limit. Players gain points by amassing land, conquering cities, and building monuments for their civilization. Unlike Risk, it is hard to go attack a specific player in HotW, since you only get one civilization each turn, and it is hard to control where your civ first appears. The biggest thing that keeps this from ever being played, though, is the long play time (one to two hours per player).\\n\\nAlso, it just feels different than most conquest-type games; it feels like you're really sweeping through epic amounts of time and the game feels a lot more laid-back and leisurely-paced than other conquest games. As a result, it takes longer to play, but it's not really cut throat at all and feels almost relaxing, which is sort of refreshing. Also, the plastic minis for the cities and forts are awesome.\\n\\nI freakin' love this game; I just don't really get to play it because of the long play time. \\n\\nUPDATE: with a few house rules, play time has been cut drastically:\\nhttps://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1751428\"},\n",

The biggest difference between this and Space Hulk being this game is over in less than 15 minutes, and the jungle board is constantly changing around the marines. There\\'s also no overwatch ability, as you can never actually see the Lurkers until you are right on top of them (they are always hiding in the foliage).\\n\\nThese are just a couple \"house rules\" I use with game, to make it a bit more enjoyable for us.\\n\\n-New jungle hexes are revealed immediately after a scout gains line of sight to an open end (instead of after all scout actions). This makes the game go along at a faster pace and gives the scouts a bit of help.\\n\\n-If a close combat on the dropship hex results in a tie, the Lurkers are routed instead of the scouts (giving the scouts a chance to win even if they lose their sergeant and heavy weapons dude). Having your sergeant and hvy weapons scout die while other scouts are still alive is a pretty anticlimactic way to lose.'},\n",

If you and your opponent are on the same level though, it's a blast.\\n\\nI want to try different casual drafting formats using my cards. I've already tried some and had a great time. I have 4 common sets and nearly 4 uncommon sets, all from 10th edition, plus a bunch of land. Got it all on eBay for around $20 (including shipping).\\n\\nThe newer sets are better in just about every way than the older ones.

Also, it feels like you spend half of the game in the hospital. In spite of the abstract movement and the crazy random arbitrary craziness, it's kind of fun.\"},\n",

       "    'comment': 'This is a fun card game with a great theme and cool cartoony artwork. Now, it\\'s called a \"Card game,\" but don\\'t take that to mean that the game has few components and only lasts for 15 minutes. The game is nearly overloaded with cards, chits, dice, boards, and tokens. This game must weigh at least 5 or 6 pounds, and it barely fits back into the box it comes in (but it fits).\\n\\nThe rulebook is pretty long, but the rules are actually quite easy. Turns consist of you trying to get resources for your doomsday device and screwing over everyone else as much as possible. The green and purple dice are way cool (though a little hard to see on my green tablecloth). It\\'s a lot of fun to threaten France or Boise or whatever and just to be an evil mad scientist for an hour. The game seems to take a while to get going though, and it can drag on if the players don\\'t have a plan or know what they\\'re doing.\\n\\nOne house rule I\\'ve found helps the game move along much quicker without significantly changing gameplay is to use more raw materials cards in the deck and change everyone\\'s special power to \"Once per turn you may discard two raw materials cards to harvest...\" instead of not drawing 2 cards. Also, everyone draws 5 raw materials cards a turn. Our games last around an hour this way.'},\n",

If SPACE HULK is ALIENS the board game, then this is PREDATOR. The biggest difference between this and Space Hulk being this game is over in less than 15 minutes, and the jungle board is constantly changing around the marines. There\\'s also no overwatch ability, as you can never actually see the Lurkers until you are right on top of them (they are always hiding in the foliage).\\n\\nThese are just a couple \"house rules\" I use with game, to make it a bit more enjoyable for us.\\n\\n-New jungle hexes are revealed immediately after a scout gains line of sight to an open end (instead of after all scout actions). This makes the game go along at a faster pace and gives the scouts a bit of help.\\n\\n-If a close combat on the dropship hex results in a tie, the Lurkers are routed instead of the scouts (giving the scouts a chance to win even if they lose their sergeant and heavy weapons dude). Having your sergeant and hvy weapons scout die while other scouts are still alive is a pretty anticlimactic way to lose.'},\n",

All the art is in some kind of anime style, and the game titles, characters, and other parts are mostly parodies or references to real video games. There\\'s 4 genres of games in the game; music, RPG, fighting, and shooter.\\n\\nPink Godzilla seems to be the illigitimate child of Godzilla and Kirby... or something like that.\\n\\nThe rules are really easy to remember and some of the cards are quite humorous if you have played a lot of videogames. We had a lot of fun cracking jokes and imagining what kind of crazy shooting game I was making with a few really weird characters and just a ton of vehichles, or a music game called \"Dance Dance Ninja Suppressors\" with the Guitar controller and a buttload of ninja characters with some flying old guys thrown in for good measure.\\n\\nWhen I played the game seemed to stall a bit near the end of the game. I\\'m not sure if this is because it was our first time playing, but we may just play to 3 completed games next time and see if that feels like a better stopping point to us.'},\n",

The rules for the different events are kind of hard to remember, so you'll probably be checking the rules a lot the first several times you play.\\n\\nOnly 16 cards required, along with the rules.

I usually don't care for efficiency exercises, but I think the modern setting and theme make it more interesting for me.\\n\\nThe game does tend to get pretty mathy and analytical, though, which can be undesirable depending on my mood. The last turn tends to bog down as everyone starts really thinking about their every expenditure and counting everything, as that last turn is the one that really counts. It's one of the better Eurogames, but I'm usually in the mood for a game with more craziness and less math.\"},\n",

I guess you have to play it several times before you \"get\" the strategy, but there wasn\\'t much there to interest me. If the strategy isn\\'t intuitive or if I can\\'t figure out what to do after a game, there has to be *something* inherently fun or interesting about the game for me to want to play it again. It\\'s not inherently fun or interesting to me though. Maybe it was partly because of the theme, but I found Ingenious and Qwirkle more engaging and interesting that this game so it wasn\\'t just the dry theme.'},\n",

The dragon that is immune to level 1 and 2 monsters is rediculous and makes almost all other monsters useless, and portals just aren't very fun (a portal! let's see what's inside! *rolls* manna!

Using the symbols is fine, but it would be [i]really helpful[/i] if the cards also told you what they did in straightforward text. There is plenty of room for a bit of text on most of the cards; they already have clarifying text on many of the cards, so it just looks lazy for the rest of the cards to have no text at all.\\n\\nSome of the cards feel a bit abstract, too, but I guess that's to be expected in a card game like this.\\n\\nBesides that, I think it's great game. It actually feels pretty thematic most of the time, and I love the setting of this game (and really don't care for the setting of Puerto Rico). Too bad its a chore to play.\"},\n",

       "    'comment': \"Plays very much like Talisman, with some key differences. You now level up instead of improve stats individually. Spells are replaced with power cards that can also be used instead of die rolls. No PvP (without expansions, at least). Three threat decks instead of one adventure deck. Relics are actually useful. The board is ridiculously busy-looking and really hard to guess where things are if you aren't really familiar with all the spaces. Overall, I like it fine, but will always want to play Talisman 4E more. Talisman is, to me, the more intuitive game, with a theme that appeals to a wider range of people, is easier to teach to new players, and has a lot more expansions that I use. Compared to Talisman, Relic feels a bit over-engineered and cluttered for what it is.\"},\n",

There is no fighting each other; it\\'s more of a race and efficiency contest between players to see who can defeat the Evil Overlord (a.k.a. \"the Nameless\") first. The rule book is the worst I\\'ve ever seen, but you can find an (actually good) English translation of it on BGG. It\\'s hard to figure out exactly how strong you have to be to win when you start playing, but when your skill+dice is 13+ you have a good chance at beating the nameless.\\n\\nIt just can\\'t get really into it like other fantasy games. Maybe it\\'s the flavorless tasks and quests, or the hokey-looking goofy CGI on the tiles and map. The fantasy world in this game is as thin and generic as I\\'ve ever seen. Also, the beardless female dwarf is a bit odd.'},\n",

Mission Risk is a great variant that shortens play time and adds another strategic element to the game. Fun when I'm in the mood, but it can take kind of a long time.\"},\n",

(people who see that they don't have the points to win have to decide who to attack) Maybe a bit too much going on for what is, ultimatley, a RISK variant.

There are various factions that change over time, different post-apocalyptic-themed figures for each faction, and lots of cool things to unlock, create, or discover during the game. And you can keep playing after the original 12 sessions, and by that point, you'll be ready to add some extra rules or upgrades, yourself.\"},\n",

This is really a light little wargame with card-based actions and several different battles going on that is a reimplementation of the older game Star Wars: The Queen\\'s Gambit. It is quite good, easy to teach and play, and doesn\\'t actually take much time, typically taking only 30-45 minutes. One of the best Star Wars board games out there, in my opinion.'},\n",

The different win conditions and starting armies for the different factions make the game asymmetric and feel a lot different from classic RISK, in a good way. The extra bits like ships, the card effects, and the Death Star are nice and thematic. With the different win conditions, it is shorter than classic RISK as well. Really good and worth getting/playing if you like RISK and Star Wars.'},\n",

Looks kind of like LotR, but a play doesn't portray the books/movies very well. The bad guys have a decided advantage in starting territories, which may be thematic, but seems more like an unfair advantage since good and bad guys have no other differences (not even in winning conditions). The way the ring ends the game sounds nice (because the game actually ends), but ends up making the winner very nearly completely random (since no one knows when the game will end for sure, so they just land grab, hoping that their turn is the last one).\\n\\nIf you like Risk and Lord of the Rings, you might like it, since it's basically regular Risk with a cheap high-fructose-corn-syrupy LotR flavor.

It has a big problem with pacing, though. It is very easy to afford some really good magic items, while taking a relatively long time to improve your stats. And I don't really like the movement dice, even though I think they are interesting. They really slow the game down.\"},\n",

       "    'comment': 'Normally a very long game (about 6 hours). Has a large amount of randomness at the start, but players should somewhat even out by the late medieval era.  Has a good, strong theme. Rules are not very good out of the box, but the game is fun with some variants and house rules (and it really needs some house rules to be much fun). Also, the pieces are great if you want to use them in other games. (I really want to try out the [i]Rhye\\'s and Fall of Civilization[/i] variant rules)\\n\\nSome people seem to have a problem with not buying any technologies during war. I\\'ve never seen this (except maybe the first time I played), as buying technology [i]really helps you[/i] during war. Buying a military tech gives you free military units (stronger ones than your enemy is using), plus if your enemy wants to use this new unit, they have to pay you to use your technology. When we played, a single army of units could only go one or two spaces before one of it\\'s unit types was obsoleted.\\n\\nA word on the game board: The border is just plain ridiculous, it\\'s so big. The four corners don\\'t really match the eras in the game (they have one for Neolithic instead of Industrial), but that doesn\\'t really matter. My biggest complaint about the board is the retarded stylized \"Earth\" map. I hate the map that comes with the game. HATE IT. The distortions and inaccuracies are [i]so bad[/i]. Worst world map I\\'ve ever seen. Seriously; worst ever. Fortunately, it\\'s not hard to make your own map (a custom map can be better balanced for a specific number of players, too. About 10-15 spaces/player is just about right).\\n\\nRating without house rules or modifications = 5'},\n",

Kind of non-confrontational feeling with players going to planets and doing stuff for points rather than interacting with each other. Interesting, but boring idea for a CCG.\\n\\nAlso, it seemed like you needed a lot more than a couple starters and some boosters to make a deck that you could actually work with. There were just so many different types of cards you got (like planets, events, ships, crew, missions, all for different factions), but really needed a number of specific types for a decent deck (like, maybe a number of decent ships and crewmen all from the Federation or Klingon empire). Also, cards didn't have a cost to put into play; this means that cards were highly imbalanced in that rares were [i]always[/i] better than commons.\"},\n",

       "    'comment': 'My favorite CCG; I enjoyed it a lot. Steep learning curve for a CGG, but all of the expansions and rules and card effects go together very well; it all fits together very nicely.  The cards also have a lot of nice detailed (often humorous) info on them for Star Wars fans. In the early days of the game, main characters were too hard to get for how good they were, and many of the interrupts relied on the main characters to work to their full effect. Fortunately, this dependency on rare main characters has been lessened with each expansion, as more great, unique, easier to get characters were released and eventually (with enhanced premiere and DSII packs) good versions of the main characters were included in starter packs or were otherwise easily obtainable. And now, most of the mains and rares are available for cheap online.\\n\\nI own a bunch of cards, mostly from Premiere, ranging all the way up to DSII (including a full set of premiere cards). The last things I bought were probably the DS2 preconstructed decks.\\n\\nSince I\\'m probably the only person in my circle of friends who owns this CCG, I have some themed decks that I try to make relatively balanced that can be fun to play against each other.\\n\\n[u]My thoughts on the various sets released:[/u]\\nBest expansion? Special Edition, IMO. It was full of cool stuff from all three movies, and this expansion really changed the feel of the game by adding objective cards and a slew of other stuff to help you get your deck to do what you want it to. \\n\\nAnother favorite? Reflections. This wasn\\'t so much a new expansion as it was a mix of all the old expansions. If you were out of the game for a little while and then came back, this was perfect for you. It had 18(!) cards per pack, way more than other sets\\' boosters for the same price.\\n\\nAnother good expansion? Hoth. It added another planet (the game only had Tatooine and the Death Star before that), along with cool combat vehicles (AT-ATs, AT-STs, and snowspeeders) for both sides. Some of the new unique characters were quite good in any setting (not just on Hoth).\\n\\nAnother good one? Third Anthology. Not really an expansion, I guess, but it was a box of various boosters and starters, with an up to date rulebook and glossary for the game (which included errata for cards that had been slightly changed). It also had some great promo cards, including R2 in Red 5 and some objectives that actually made the epic events in A New Hope usable.\\n\\nOK expansions?\\nA New Hope: the first expansion. Added more cards to the mix, including the Death Star and Ghhhk/Houjix (a great interrupt), but I feel like it favored the LS over the DS with all the new Rebel pilots and matching ships. Maybe this was a good thing, as I feel that the LS was a bit weaker than the DS in Premeire if neither player had the main characters. The epic events were cool in theory, but impossible to use (each one needed a combo of around 10 cards to pull off).\\n\\nJabba\\'s Palace: This expansion introduced starting interrupts and a bunch of other \"tutors\" to the game. With Jabba, the audiance chamber, and all the aliens that have special abilities there, this expansion favored the DS. In fact, if you see a DS deck without an objective, I\\'d be surprised if it wasn\\'t based around Jabba\\'s Palace.\\n\\nEndor/DSII: I didn\\'t buy much of these expansions, and this is about where I stopped buying cards, but both of them were released close to each other and were well balanced between the LS and DS, I thought. There was some obvious power creep here, though; a lot of the weapons were just straight-up better than earlier ones (probably because most weapons sucked in earlier blocks). One of the best things to come out here was the preconstructed decks, each one comming with some great cards (like good versions of Han, Chewie, and Ackbar in the LS one, and an AT-AT, some AT-STs, and some decent ships and pilots in the DS one).\\n\\nCrappy expansions?\\nDegobah. The worst. After Hoth, I was like, \"What the heck is this?\" It didn\\'t seem to have any good cards that weren\\'t really rare. It introduced new lame ways to drain your opponent\\'s force without interacting with him in any way (in the form of cards like Asteroid Sanctuary and the Jedi Tests). The DS got the Executor and a bunch of bounty hunters (but no Fett), which was cool, but everything else about this expansion sucked. It was so bad that a lot of people quit the game at about the time this expansion came out.\\n\\nCloud City. Nothing special. All sorts of lame rules on capturing people. Cloud sectors. Wonky Sabbac rules that served no real purpose in the game. *yawn*\\n\\nI\\'ll just throw Tatooine and Couruscant down here. I have some cards from both, though I\\'ve never actually played with them. The defensive shields seem like a good idea, but podracing as an effective way to retrieve/drain force, plus all the other episode I stuff, really changes the game. There was some major power creep going on here, too. Maybe I just don\\'t like the idea of episode I cards mingling with the original trilogy cards, but I don\\'t like it. The new \"maintenance\" cards (e.g. Han, Chewie, and the Falcon) seem way overpowered, too. I do like \"Great shot, Kid!\", as it makes the \"Massassi Base Operations\" objective more viable.'},\n",

Why not use Lothal, Kuat, Eriadu, etc?), which is sort of annoying, but those are my only complaints about the game, really. It's really good.\"},\n",

       "    'comment': 'All kinds of awesome. There are so many different unit types and technologies and stuff, it\\'s nearly overwhelming when you are playing for the first few times. You could do or build something different every game for quite a few games and still learn about the way different units interact and how well some units/technologies are in different situations. (though it seems that archons, battlecruisers, and ultralisks are the way to go most of the time)\\n\\nThe combat deck ROCKS. It\\'s like a whole game of DOMINION thrown into a conquest-type game, only better, because instead of buying a card that lets you draw an extra card or that is a useless VP, you get a Nuke card, or a Stim Packs tech that beefs up your marines, or Increased Carrier Capacity so everyone fears your floating beehive of doom. The cards have a Magic-esque feel to them, too, how they each have an attack and health value and sometimes special abilities, or some of them are enchantments/support cards that boost your main dudes.\\nAt first, I felt that you drew way too many combat cards during the game, but after a couple plays I saw that that isn\\'t true at all; I only had a ton of combat cards when I was researching and not fighting. The rest of the time, you\\'ll be attacking people and getting attacked and you\\'ll lose your Ultralisk because you don\\'t have a matching card or stuff like that.\\nSpeaking of losing your Ultralisk, the cards do a good job of emulating unit health/shield levels, too. Let\\'s say you have in your hand, 2 Ultralisk cards (one with health 9 and one with health 7) and a zergling card. Your Ultralisk gets attacked and you use your health 9 card to destroy some Terran meat. Later that turn, you get attacked again and use your health 7 card, but your Ultralisk just barely manages to survive the battle. If you are attacked again before you get another Ultralisk card, that \\'lisk is probably dead. The cards are great at representing health levels AND energy levels (for special abilities). This is why the Zerg get to draw a card after each battle; it represents their quick natural healing. The Protoss draw extra cards when they are attacked as a representation of their shields.\\n\\nThe order placement part of the game is cool, though it is probably the most difficult rule for people to grasp at first. It lets people see where people are doing things at the start of the turn, but they don\\'t know what they\\'re doing or when they are doing them. You can even mess up other people\\'s plans by placing your orders on other people\\'s. Also, the way you spend resources is simple and intuitive and is great because it doesn\\'t require bookkeeping. On the other hand, managing all your little worker tokens is annoying and can get \"fiddly\".\\n\\nUnfortunately, all players need to be paying attention and trying to prevent everyone else from winning for the game to be tense and exciting to the end. The only thing I don\\'t like about the game is the way the special victories can end it in a spectacularly anticlimactic fashion sometimes. (I\\'d like to try Brood War to see how it changes things, or try out Brood War\\'s \\'survival\\' variant win conditions)\\n\\nOne of the most fun things about the game is all the times you can quote the units from the PC game. You get to say stuff like \"\"My life for Aiur!!!\" and \"I\\'m about to drop the hammer, and dispense some indiscriminate justice!\" One more good thing about the game is that it feels and plays like an epic \"monster game\", but you can fit it into a few hours.\\n\\nAlso, the minis simply rock; they have got to be the most awesome board game components I own. The only thing that keeps it from being played more is the high level of thinkyness it requires (and the accompanying mental exhaustion).'},\n",

It will probably make games go along a bit faster, since you can now buy your way to greatness.\\n\\nexamples of stuff you can buy:\\nBattleaxe: +3 strength in battle, opponents cannot use ARMOR to stop life loss\\nSpellbook: you always have a spell\\nLUCKY the PANDA: a follow that lets you replenish a fate every turn\\n\\nIt's crazy.\\n\\nThe alt endings are pretty lame (as usual), but the characters look cool.\\n\\nAlso, I LOVE that you can send people to jail from outside the city (e.g. the Crown of Command). No one can escape the long arm of the law!\\n\\nThe only thing I don't like is that some of the stuff is just too good, totally unbalanced in some ways, even for Talisman (Scribe follower, for example), and there are a few shops that never see any use.\"},\n",

I basically see this expansion as a couple cool variant inner region boards, somce cool new characters, some alt. endings, and a bunch of new cards and tokens with several different suggestions in the rulebook on how to use them.\\n\\nThe \"normal\" way to play the Dragon expansion REALLY changes the game and sort of has an Arkham Horror feel to it, which I think is interesting, but I\\'m not really a big fan of it. See my review:\\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/thread/752603/gratuitous-dragons-and-token-drawing\\n\\nMy newest way to use the dragon stuff is to treat the Dragon Tower as a separate board accessible from the Portal of Power space. You move within it with a die roll as normal and draw from a combine dragon deck (all three dragon decks shuffled together, with cards referencing sleep, tokens, or rage removed. Fight a random dragon king at the top and gain a treasure and move to any space in outer/middle region if you win.'},\n",

       "    'comment': 'New characters, new spells, and the new Dungeon region, with its accompanying Dungeon cards, Treasure cards, and Dungeon-related Adventure cards, are all fantastic! The new Dungeon is way better than any of the older editions\\'; it is much larger, has a lot more cards, and has some nice rewards to make it worth the effort.\\n\\nAs another path to the Crown of Command, the Dungeon is great. It isn\\'t easier than the traditional route, BUT in some situations it IS easier. With the Reaper and Dungeon expansions, there are lots of weapons, followers, abilities, and spells that can make you kick giant butt in combat even though you\\'re not strong/craft enough to get through the inner region. In this case, the Dungeon is for you!\\n\\nAlso, the Dungeon can be played stand-alone. It is fairly brutal on starting characters this way (you may want to use the \\'extra stats\\' variant), and the game lasts 20-30 minutes. The feel of it kind of reminds me of DungeonQuest, actually.\\n\\nThe only things I don\\'t like about it are the Dungeon Door cards (you can\\'t exit the Dungeon to them unless you fall through a trapdoor, and they\\'re sort of redundant with the ruins space being the enterance) and Trapdoor cards (I think they should make you fall [i]deeper[/i] into the Dungeon, not \"fall\" back up to the enterance!?).'},\n",

There are a number of cards that burn a bunch of cards off the adventure deck, which is an interesting way of making the Firelands cards float to the top (they won't be burned).\\n\\nAfter several plays, I find the firelands tokens to be a bit fiddly, and I don't really like them.

       "    'comment': 'Alternate endings are a welcome addition to the game; too bad there\\'s only three, and the two that can be hidden are kind of lame. Extra characters, adventure cards, and spells are always welcome and appreciated. Many of the new spells and adventure cards have some pretty nasty effects; many can turn you into a toad, especially the awesome new spell TOADIFY. For nasty cards, there\\'s also the Basilisk, a STR 2 monster that has a 1/6 chance of killing you outright! The majority are pretty tame, though.\\n\\nNot sure about the Warlock character; he starts in the middle region and draws his full compliment of spells every turn. Seems a bit ridiculous.\\n\\nAlso, the \"Crown and Sceptre\" ending is too quick of an ending. As written, a character casts the command spell on every character during EVERY PLAYER\\'S turn, instead of just his own. In a 4 player game, someone getting to the crown will win before his next turn! We\\'ll probably house rule that ending so a player can only cast the command spell on his own turn, because the ending is pretty cool besides that one bit.\\n\\nI\\'m not really fond of the ice/snow setting, but fortunately only a portion of the expansion\\'s adventure cards have it.'},\n",

This Omen deck is the least game-changing, mostly focusing on PvP interactions)\\n*Rise of the Undead (Classic Zombie apocalypse, eventually turns all enemy cards and even strangers into Undead enemies!)\\n*\"The Stars Align\" (A Cthulhu reference, increases magic powers in the game, and then totally destroys all magic in the game)\\n*Shattered World (Throws down Terrain cards all over the place)\\n\\nThe Characters are a bit more complicated than most, but they are all pretty good. The Celestial is especially nice, geared towards PvP.\\n\\nThe Harbinger cards, and some of the terrain cards, are pretty nasty. You do NOT want to be drawing Harbinger cards.\\n\\nOverall, this expansion gives you a sense of urgency and inserts a bit of Biblical themes into the game, which is nice.

Also, the destinies and paths can be surprisingly beneficial, which is nice. The Celtic and Fairy Tale themed encounters and especially the Path cards give the region a distinctly different feel than the rest of the game. The characters are a bit more fiddly with extra tokens, but they have interesting effects, so it's all good. Overall, the woodland is a great place to visit, giving out what are probably the best rewards in the game (all expansions included).\"},\n",

It is also very difficult for characters starting in Timescape to make it through alive.  The players don't run into each other nearly as much when Timescape is in play, as some players will spend all their time there once they are strong enough and players cannot meet each other there.  I'm also not a fan of the way the paths are set up; you have no choice in what realms/planets you go to.  You're just along for the ride once you enter Timescape.Basically, Timescape takes a lot of the player interaction out of Talisman, and I don't like that.\"},\n",

       "    'comment': 'Kind of like Ticket to Ride (I guess) in that you collect sets of cards to make routes (kind of) and get points, but is missing a few key things I like about Ticket to Ride:\\n-Trains. Trains are [i]way[/i] cooler than mail carriages.\\n-Familiar cities. A map of the US is just cool and more familiar.\\n-Easier setup and simpler rules.\\n-Direct interaction with other players. In TtR, you compete for tracks and routes and block other players from using them. You can\\'t do anything like that in Thurn and Taxis.\\n-A cool theme. Did I mention trains are cooler than mail carriages? Maybe if the game was rethemed as \"Turnin\\' Taxis\" and set in New York City and players build up taxi cab companies, I\\'d like it more.\\n-Tension; it just doesn\\'t have any.\\n-It\\'s really freaking lame, by comparison.'},\n",

This monster of a game takes good planning to get to the table, but it is oh so satisfying...\\n\\nAs a long time fan of Master of Orion II and other civilization games and sci-fi games, the theme for this one is perfect for me.

A lot of the fun in Warhammer is using your own assembled and painted minis, and hanging out with friends; kind of like a nerd's version of a superbowl party.\"},\n",

       "    'comment': 'After Decipher lost the Star Wars license, they made WARS TCG, a CCG that kept the essence of the gameplay of Star Wars CCG, but without the license. It plays similarly to SWCCG in its early sets, but with most sites focusing on a single planet, and with steamlined rules and a more balanced mix of cards.\\n\\nWARS is awesome. Decipher learned some things about CCG mechanics from designing SWCCG, and WARS has some definite improvements. One drawback is (of course) that it\\'s not Star Wars. But on the plus side, the problem of super rare mains that you NEED in order to have a good deck is gone. There are characters with proper names, but they usually only have power 1 and are not the type of card you want to make up a large part of your deck; the more common units usually represent entire squads and are more powerful in battle. The card sets and gameplay is similar to the early sets of SWCCG, but with some of the more interesting things from the later sets (like \\'tutors\\', multiple battle destinies, the ability to \\'stack the deck\\', and weapons that are actually good). There are also new interesting things, like cards that can be \"inverted\", with different stats or abilities in its inverted state, and cards that can add to the attrition afflicted in battle. There\\'s also a special type of location, called \"encampments\", that may be placed as new locations, or underneath existing locations to make it more valuable.\\n\\nThe rules in WARS are also more streamlined than SWCCG. For example, there are no specific rules for docking bay transit; docking bay rules are simplified and stated right in the docking bay location text. All vehicles and ships are assumed to be piloted, and weapons\\' abilities are used like interrupts instead of having their own set of rules.\\n\\nWARS is better than SWCCG for people who want to play with a draft format; it has 5 factions that all feel different, and you can use any cards in a single deck that you want. A card from a faction requires you to have one to three of that faction\\'s locations on the board in order to play it, to prevent people from playing \"5 color\" decks without consequences. It sort of feels like they merged the 5 color thing from Magic into SWCCG. \"[-]Mana[/-] location screw\" shouldn\\'t a problem because you can pick a good starting location that should let you place most of your units all by itself, and it\\'s much easier to find a specific card in your deck than it is in Magic.\\n\\nBest of all, WARS has very good artwork for a CCG, and it has an interesting backstory for a game not based on an existing fictional work. The main knocks against the game, as I see it, are the relatively steep learning curve and play time (almost an hour), which are both barriers to getting new people to play (which are also the same knocks against SWCCG). It\\'s a cool game that I unfortunately haven\\'t had opportunity to play very much.\\n\\nIn summary, it\\'s cheap, draft-friendly, and a great game. You can pick up all 6 preconstructed decks, plus 2 booster boxes for $20.'},\n",

I think watching soccer is boring, but I really enjoyed this game.\"},\n",

I really enjoy the XCOM PC games, too, and this is an interesting, if abstract, way of reimagining the overall strategic layer of the game as a board game. I just wish the final mission felt/looked more like a definitive final mission (make it an assault on the alien's temple/mothership or Mars installation or alien commander's battleship or something!) Also, the wireframe graphics on the tech cards are lame; they could have used pictures of the completed projects, instead. And lastly, while I appreciate the suspense and stress the alien threat/die adds to the game, losing everyone commited to a roll at once for a single bad rool just feels unfair. I'd rather they added more aliens and made the threat roll a bit less brutal.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoy playing this, in spite of the flaws.\"},\n",

       "    'comment': \"It feels sort of like Pandemic, only with zombies instead of disease cubes, and every man for himself. Unfortunately, it sort of feels like multiplayer solitaire most of the time, with each person playing their own game of Pandemic. Most of the player interaction comes into play when you lure zombie hoards in your border states into your opponents' territories, and you can nuke your neighbors, but only if you research that tech. We may have missed a rule on this, but it seems like you can't trade resources with other players, which is too bad since that would be a good source of player interaction; it feels like you SHOULD be able to trade resources, since they are gathered and spent like in Settlers of Catan (resources are wood/metal, chemical, fuel, and food).\\n\\nAll that being said, it is still a cool game, and is really impressive for what is basically an independently published game. You get that sinking feeling after the first turn or two that you're really screwed and just have to do the best you can to preserve as many of your people as possible, while desperately using your dwindling resources working your way through the tech tree towards something that will possible prolong the inevitable.\"},\n",
