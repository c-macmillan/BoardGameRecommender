One card is then cut from the draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then play cards in turn, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs along tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until both players have exhausted their hand of cards.&#10;&#10;Next, each player picks up their hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled and the deal alternates.

But you don't take all the relevant cards, only the cards that meet one of these requirements:&#10;&#10;1. the color is the same as color of the card just played, or &#10;2. the number is the same or lower than the card just played&#10;&#10;The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted or when one player has collected all six colors in their point piles. Then everyone plays one last card. From the four cards remaining in their hand, players choose two cards to add to his or her point piles. The player who has the least negative points after this is the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;Normally, negative points are same the number on the card. But if you have the most cards in a certain color, each of your cards of that color counts as only 1 negative point!&#10;&#10;Thus, play your cards well!&#10;&#10;\", 'complexity_score': 1.465, 'year_published': 2007.0, 'expected_play_time': 45.0, 'avg_rating': 6.99, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lmRNihICb4mklj0ec1vj6g__micro/img/l_ey4-mYopII8Cixo4_7YzOHpzs=/fit-in/64x64/filters:strip_icc()/pic2239001.jpg', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/lmRNihICb4mklj0ec1vj6g__original/img/FA-gxYbwNAZl_jwzPjU9n_0Nwbo=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic2239001.jpg', 'min_play_time': 45.0, 'max_play_time': 45.0, 'rank': 875, 'similarity': 0.1}, {'id': 43528, 'num_ratings': 4932, 'name': 'World Without End', 'short_descrption': 'A board game based on the novel by Ken Follett, a sequel to The Pillars of the Earth.', 'long_description': 'Die Tore der Welt / World Without End is based on the novel by Ken Follett, a sequel to his bestselling The Pillars of the Earth.

In LCBG you play 3 rounds, scoring at the end of all 3 for the monuments you collect. (Normal scoring occurs each round.) In Keltis, you only play 1 round, and score everything each round. This is not just a rule difference, as the scoring is different for the monuments/stones based on the number collected.&#10;&#10;2. In Keltis, you may play your cards in either order, descending, high to low, or ascending, low to high. In LCBG, you must play in ascending order.&#10;&#10;Note: the rules for LCBG have the Keltis rules as variants, and have the board elements necessary for #1 above. Keltis does not have the rules nor board elements to play LCBG.&#10;&#10;&#10;     Kosmos (Keltis publisher) changed the card play to ascending and descending order to lower the luck level and add balance to the game.&#10;     Kosmos changed the theme to fit in with other Kosmos abstract game series. &#10;&#10;&#10;There are more differences, which are non-substantive. Lost Cities: The Board Game has a different-looking board, tiles and figures (meeples) to connect with its predecessor. Card-play in descending order is an optional variant in this edition. The numbers have been multiplied by 5 to strengthen the relation to the card game, and instead of a scoring track you collect your points as golden coins.&#10;&#10;&#10;From the Keltis entry:&#10;&#10;Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. There are cards with 5 different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards either ascending or descending. Like Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths, since the last spaces grants high points, but ending early gives negative ones.&#10;&#10;The player in turn plays one card (out of a hand of 8), or discards one. He moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus - either direct points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wish stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.&#10;&#10;The game ends when a total of 5 playing pieces have reached the 7th space (or more) on their paths. Now, scoring happens:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Pieces which only moved 1-3 steps give negative points (-4, -3, -2).&#10;     Pieces with 4+ steps grant points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10).&#10;     One piece of each player is higher and scores double.&#10;     Fewer than two wish stones grants negative points (-3 / -4)&#10;     5+ wish stones yield a bonus of 10 points.&#10;     All this is added to the points scored during the game&#10;&#10;&#10;\", 'complexity_score': 1.725, 'year_published': 2008.0, 'expected_play_time': 60.0, 'avg_rating': 6.79, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d-LqrhWAEuIxdEL6DoR2Jg__micro/img/H4IpeiCAhPZWn2mMtieqKwnFjUY=/fit-in/64x64/filters:strip_icc()/pic4597093.jpg', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/d-LqrhWAEuIxdEL6DoR2Jg__original/img/g3AWiUSkXhDdzi7lpVZK0T4kjtg=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic4597093.jpg', 'min_play_time': 30.0, 'max_play_time': 60.0, 'rank': 1406, 'similarity': 0.1}, {'id': 1403, 'num_ratings': 4629, 'name': 'Turn the Tide', 'short_descrption': 'Keep outguessing your opponents to stay afloat, then repeat when playing their hands.', 'long_description': \"Players are dealt a hand of 12 from a deck of 1-60 (the remainder go back in the box for the whole game), and then lay out marker cards that show the other players the strength of their hand.

An English edition was released in the fourth quarter of 2010. The designer of the game, Klaus Teuber, has stated that he completely reworked many of the original card game's mechanics to make it easier for newcomers to play the game.&#10;&#10;Each player portrays a prince for Catan, developing their individual provinces and competing to build a more successful province than the other.  The basic mode of play is similar to the original Catan Card Game, where players expand their provinces by building settlements connected by roads.  Players may also build expansions in their settlements that aid them in various ways, or upgrade their settlements to cities to allow more expansions to be built.  They build these additions by using resources that they accumulate each turn, which are determined by the roll of a die.  Cards are drawn on each turn to replenish the players' hands.  The players may also use action cards that directly affect either their own province or their opponent's province.&#10;&#10;The Rivals for Catan features a reduced pool of cards, without the more aggressive style of action cards found in the original Catan Card Game.  Therefore, all action cards will be able to be used from the beginning of the game unlike in the original card game.&#10;&#10;Ways to Play:&#10;The Introductory Game focuses on the basics of the card game, featuring gameplay that is more appropriate for newcomers.  This game is played to 7 victory points and includes 36 Expansion Cards in four stacks.  This play style should take beginner players 25 to 30 minutes to play.&#10;&#10;Three Theme Games add more rules, expansions, and aggressive cards.  These Theme Games may be played individually or combined to play a variant called &quot;The Duel of the Princes.&quot;  Each Theme Game adds 24 Expansion and Event Cards to the cards from the Introductory Game, which are placed in two stacks separately from the cards from the Introductory Game.  When playing a Theme Game, playtime should be around 45 to 60 minutes.&#10;&#10;As with the original Catan Card Game, players can also play the Tournament Game, in which each player chooses specific cards to build their deck ahead of time from which they draw from during the game.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;The theme of The Rivals for Catan is no longer restricted only to the feudal era of the Middle Ages like the original Catan Card Game.  The Introductory Game portrays the very early years of the world of Catan, while each Theme Game takes place in progressively later eras.  These eras are known as &quot;The Era of Gold,&quot; &quot;The Era of Turmoil,&quot; and &quot;The Era of Progress.&quot;&#10;&#10;Belongs to the Catan Series.&#10;&#10;\", 'complexity_score': 2.3225, 'year_published': 2010.0, 'expected_play_time': 120.0, 'avg_rating': 6.95, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n5x9eZiQ7Da4SQjB7M41-w__micro/img/98ru3X2FGliVWEHwtf5t1JX7k6U=/fit-in/64x64/filters:strip_icc()/pic6877018.jpg', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/n5x9eZiQ7Da4SQjB7M41-w__original/img/Y6dJpidB1624ox-QCAdiSVsCnf4=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic6877018.jpg', 'min_play_time': 45.0, 'max_play_time': 120.0, 'rank': 981, 'similarity': 0.1}, {'id': 760, 'num_ratings': 16964, 'name': 'Battle Line', 'short_descrption': 'Mobilize stronger formations to counter the enemy along an ever-changing battle-line.', 'long_description': \"Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags.

Completed domaines can then be expanded, even into your opponents'. Protect domaines by placing knights, which resist expansion.&#10;&#10;Actions are taken by playing cards that have a cost associated with them. Gain money by selling cards and controlling mines. Sold cards can be acquired by other players.&#10;&#10;Players score points based on the quantity and type of terrain enclosed in their domaines, as well as by controlling many mines of a single type. The winner is the first player to cross a specific point threshold or the player with the most points when the card deck runs out.&#10;&#10;\", 'complexity_score': 2.7167, 'year_published': 2003.0, 'expected_play_time': 60.0, 'avg_rating': 6.98, 'thumbnail_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9OCBvjQKVfNattSqBy4k1Q__micro/img/lm4CEmS_A--xAZC8J0euQ_ITTGk=/fit-in/64x64/filters:strip_icc()/pic21368.jpg', 'image_url': 'https://cf.geekdo-images.com/9OCBvjQKVfNattSqBy4k1Q__original/img/Z4BHJ1OVovYSNeLgJvOkT1GYVJQ=/0x0/filters:format(jpeg)/pic21368.jpg', 'min_play_time': 60.0, 'max_play_time': 60.0, 'rank': 1123, 'similarity': 0.1}, {'id': 198994, 'num_ratings': 16461, 'name': 'Hero Realms', 'short_descrption': 'Compete head-to-head to create the most powerful deck of spells and minions!', 'long_description': \"Hero Realms is a fantasy-themed deck-building game that is an adaptation of the award-winning Star Realms game.

The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.

There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table.

Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns.
